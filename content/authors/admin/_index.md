Hi, my name is Jian Li and this is my jiǎn lì (简历). It's a play on words that the chinese word and pronunciation of Résumé is similar to my first and last name. This website is intended to be just that, a jiǎn lì. If you have a opportunity or project that could use my help or just want to get in touch, then let's resume this conversation.
