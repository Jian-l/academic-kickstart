Web domains as you may have guess are hard to come by and jianli.com is unfortunately taken.

This website is a play on words that CV or **简历** (jiǎn lì) in chinese have similar pronunciation and is spelled identically to my name.

This website is just intended to be a **简历**. If you have a project or opportunity that you think could use my help or just want to drop me a note, drop me a note and get in touch with the actual Jian Li.
