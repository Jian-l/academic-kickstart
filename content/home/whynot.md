You may wonder why the url is not jian li. The story behind the url is this:

1. Web domains are hard to come by and jianli.com was taken.
2. CV or 简历 (jiǎn lì) in chinese have similar pronunciation in chinese and is spelled identically to my name.

I hope something here have caught your eye and made you want to learn more about the actual Jian Li, and not just my 简历.

If you have a opportunity or project that you think could use my help or just want to drop me a note, please feel free to get in touch!
