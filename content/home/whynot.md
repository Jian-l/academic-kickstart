Web domains as you may have guess are hard to come by and jianli.com is unfortunately taken.

This website is a play on words that CV or **简历** (jiǎn lì) in chinese have similar pronunciation in chinese and is spelled identically to my name.

What I hope you take away from this is there is more to me than just my **简历**.

If you have a opportunity or project that you think could use my help or just want to drop me a note, please feel free to get in touch!
